.. moduleauthor:: Ettore Sani

Action client:
    /move_base to reach a desired position in space.

This module implements the autonomous driving modality, which allows the robot to reach a specified position in space.
The program sends a goal to the action server /move_base, receiving feedbacks and monitoring the status until the goal 
is reached or canceled. Thanks to the gmapping algorithm, the robot can create a map of the surrounding environment 
during its tours. The move_base node implements the action server to control the robot through the shortest path to 
reach the given position. The user can also require to cancel the current goal or to send a new one.</verbatim> </para>
